## Overview
This document presents the results of running mathematical misconception experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.5, comparing its performance with the original GPT-4 results using semantic similarity analysis.

## Methodology
- **Model**: Claude-3-sonnet-20240229
- **Parameters**:
  * Temperature: 0.2
  * Max tokens: 2000
  * Frequency penalty: 0.0
- **Semantic Analysis**:
  * Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (sentence-transformers)
  * Similarity threshold: 0.7
  * Sample size: 100 examples per experiment

## Experiment Results

### 1. Cross-Topic Testing
Original GPT-4 (expert validated): 65.45%
Claude Results:
- Raw Exact Match: 0.00%
- Semantic Similarity: 3.00%
- Average Similarity Score: 0.489
- Median Similarity Score: 0.505

Top Performing Topics:
1. Number Operations: 8.33% (24 examples)
2. Equations and inequalities: 8.33% (12 examples)
3. Algebraic representations: 0.00% (5 examples)

Example Prediction:
```
Actual: "when students wrongly divide fractions by splitting numerators and denominators into separate divisions, ignoring remainders"
Claude: "Failure to understand fraction operations and applying whole number operations to fractions"
Similarity Score: 0.697
```

### 2. Topic-Constrained Testing
Original GPT-4 (expert validated): 83.91%
Claude Results:
- Raw Exact Match: 2.00%
- Semantic Similarity: 17.00%
- Average Similarity Score: 0.512
- Median Similarity Score: 0.492

Top Performing Topics:
1. Number Operations: 33.33% (18 examples)
2. Properties of number and operations: 33.33% (12 examples)
3. Ratios and proportional reasoning: 20.00% (10 examples)

Example Prediction:
```
Actual: "when students inaccurately simplify fractions by guessing instead of dividing"
Claude: "The misconception demonstrated is the incorrect assumption that a smaller fractional value subtracted from a given fraction will always result in a larger difference, without actually performing the subtraction and comparing the resulting values"
Similarity Score: 0.607
```

## Analysis

### Key Findings
1. Claude shows significantly better performance when evaluated using semantic similarity compared to exact string matching
2. Performance improves notably in topic-constrained testing (17% vs 3%)
3. Strongest performance in number operations and properties across both experiments
4. Lower overall scores compared to GPT-4's expert-validated results suggest automated metrics may be stricter

### Response Characteristics
1. Claude tends to provide more formal, pedagogical descriptions
2. Responses often include detailed explanations of the misconception
3. Performance improves significantly when testing within the same topic
4. Responses demonstrate understanding but use different phrasing

## Recommendations
1. Consider expert validation for fair comparison with GPT-4 results
2. Adjust similarity threshold based on expert review of predictions
3. Standardize misconception descriptions for future experiments
4. Explore hybrid evaluation methods combining automated metrics with expert validation

## Technical Implementation
The semantic similarity analysis was implemented using:
- Python's sentence-transformers library
- Cosine similarity for comparing embeddings
- Automated threshold-based classification
- Topic-specific performance tracking
