The fraction 1/2 is not equal to 1/4. This seems to be a misunderstanding or miscalculation.\n\n2. **Addition of Fractions**: When adding fractions, you need a common denominator. The fractions 3/4 and 1/2 have different denominators (4 and 2, respectively).\n\nHere's the correct way to add these fractions:\n\n1. **Find a Common Denominator**: The least common denominator of 4 and 2 is 4.\n\n2. **Convert Fractions**: \n   - The fraction 3/4 already has the denominator 4.\n   - Convert 1/2 to a fraction with the denominator 4. To do this, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2: \n     \\[\n     1/2 = (1 \\times 2)/(2 \\times 2) = 2/4\n     \\]\n\n3. **Add the Fractions**: \n   - Now that both fractions have the same denominator, you can add them:\n     \\[\n     3/4 + 2/4 = (3 + 2)/4 = 5/4\n     \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\(5/4\\) or \\(1 \\frac{1}{4}\\) as a mixed number.",

The ratio is initially written as 35:25.\n\nTo simplify this ratio, you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The GCD of 35 and 25 is 5.\n\nNow, divide both numbers by their GCD:\n\n- 35 \u00f7 5 = 7\n- 25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\nThus, the simplest form of the ratio of red glass balls to green glass balls is 7:5.",

The terms \\(5x\\) and \\(6x\\) are like terms because they both contain the variable \\(x\\). When you combine them, you add their coefficients:\n\n\\[ 5x + 6x = (5 + 6)x = 11x \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[ 11x = 110 \\]\n\nStep 2: Solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{110}{11} \\]\n\n\\[ x = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is \\(x = 10\\).\n\nThe incorrect answer \\(x = 0\\) likely resulted from a misunderstanding of how to handle the equation, possibly confusing the process of combining terms or incorrectly simplifying the equation. The step \"50 + 60 = 110\" seems to be an attempt to substitute \\(x = 0\\) into the equation, but this is not a valid step in solving for \\(x\\).",
