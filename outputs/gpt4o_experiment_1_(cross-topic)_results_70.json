A 5-kg package costs $9.00.\n\nTo find the cost structure, let's assume the cost to ship a package is composed of a fixed base cost (B) plus a variable cost per kilogram (C). Therefore, the cost equation can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = B + C \\times \\text{Weight (kg)} \\]\n\nWe can set up the following system of equations based on the given data:\n\n1. \\( B + 8C = 12.90 \\)\n2. \\( B + 3C = 6.40 \\)\n3. \\( B + 5C = 9.00 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find B and C.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[ (B + 8C) - (B + 3C) = 12.90 - 6.40 \\]\n\\[ 5C = 6.50 \\]\n\\[ C = 1.30 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( C = 1.30 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ B + 3(1.30) = 6.40 \\]\n\\[ B + 3.90 = 6.40 \\]\n\\[ B = 2.50 \\]\n\nThus, the cost structure is:\n- Base cost (B) = $2.50\n- Cost per kilogram (C) = $1.30\n\nTherefore, the cost to ship a 1-kg package would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for 1 kg} = B + 1 \\times C = 2.50 + 1.30 = 3.80 \\]\n\nEach additional kilogram would cost $1.30.",

However, for quadratic functions like \\( f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1 \\), the inverse is not a function unless you restrict the domain of the original function to make it one-to-one. Without such a restriction, the inverse will not pass the vertical line test.\n\n### (b) Table of Data Points for the Inverse Function\n\n**Misconception:** The table is incomplete and does not provide any data points.\n\n**Correction:** To create a table of data points for the inverse, you would swap the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values of selected points from the original function. For example, if \\( f(a) = b \\), then the inverse will have the point \\( (b, a) \\).\n\n1. Choose some \\( x \\)-values, compute \\( y = f(x) \\), and then swap them.\n2. Example points for \\( f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x - 1 \\):\n   - If \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = -1 \\). So, for the inverse, we have the point \\( (-1, 0) \\).\n   - If \\( x = 1 \\), \\( y = 4 \\). So, for the inverse, we have the point \\( (4, 1) \\).\n\n### (c) Find the Explicit Equation for the Inverse Function\n\n**Misconception:** The provided solution attempts to solve \\( 2x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0 \\), which is not the correct approach for finding the inverse.\n\n**Correction:** To find the inverse of a quadratic function, you need to solve for \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). Start by setting \\( y = 2x^2 + 3x - 1 \\) and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Rearrange the equation: \\( 2x^2 + 3x - (y + 1) = 0 \\).\n2. Use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-(y+1))}}{2 \\cdot 2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 8(y+1)}}{4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{8y + 17}}{4}\n   \\]\n\n3. The inverse function is not a single function unless you restrict the domain of the original function. You would typically choose one of the solutions (either the positive or negative square root) based on the domain restriction.\n\nIn summary, the inverse of a quadratic function is not straightforward and requires careful consideration of domain restrictions to ensure it remains a function.",
