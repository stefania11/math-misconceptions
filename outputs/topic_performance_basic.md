### Patterns, relationships, and functions
- Exact Match Rate: 0.0%
- Sample Size: 13

Example Predictions:

Actual: when students struggle to represent key aspects and relationships in patterns, as seen in attempts like graphical representations missing key components
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case involves misunderstanding the concept of equality and how to represent it algebraically. The problem requires setting up an equation to solve for the number of candies in Kyle's bowl. The correct approach is to recognize that the total number of candies Kyle has (the candies in the bowl plus the 4 additional candies) is equal to the total number of candies Andrew has (14 candies). 

The correct algebraic representation should be: 

Let \( x \) be the number of candies in Kyle's bowl. Then the equation is:
\[ x + 4 = 14 \]

The misconception here is that the student did not translate the verbal description into an algebraic equation. Instead, they represented the situation graphically without establishing the relationship between the quantities using an equation. This indicates a misunderstanding of how to use algebra to represent and solve problems involving equality and unknown quantities.
Exact Match: False

Actual: when students struggle to interpret graph scales accurately
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case involves misunderstanding the visual representation of data due to a broken axis on a bar graph. The student incorrectly perceives the difference in bar heights as indicating a much larger difference in values than actually exists. This is because the y-axis does not start at zero, and the break in the axis exaggerates the visual difference between the two bars. The student fails to recognize that the actual numerical difference between the two days is much smaller than it appears visually. This misconception highlights the importance of understanding how graph scales and axis breaks can distort the perception of data.

### Number Operations
- Exact Match Rate: 0.0%
- Sample Size: 35

Example Predictions:

Actual: when students find common denominators but wrongly keep the original numerators unchanged
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case is related to the misunderstanding of how to add fractions with different denominators. The student incorrectly changes the fraction 1/2 to 1/4 without finding a common denominator. Instead of converting both fractions to have a common denominator, the student mistakenly alters the value of 1/2 to match the denominator of 3/4, which leads to an incorrect sum. 

The correct approach should involve finding a common denominator for the fractions 3/4 and 1/2, which is 4 in this case. The fraction 1/2 should be converted to 2/4, not 1/4, so the correct addition would be:

3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4 or 1 1/4. 

This misconception highlights a lack of understanding of the process required to add fractions with unlike denominators.
Exact Match: False

Actual: when students find common denominators but wrongly keep the original numerators unchanged
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case involves misunderstanding how to add fractions with different denominators. The student incorrectly adds the numerators and denominators separately, as if they were adding whole numbers, which results in an incorrect answer. This suggests a lack of understanding of the need to find a common denominator before adding fractions. The correct process involves converting the fractions to have the same denominator (in this case, 1/2 becomes 2/4 and 1/4 remains 1/4), and then adding the numerators while keeping the common denominator, resulting in 3/4.
Exact Match: False

### Number sense
- Exact Match Rate: 0.0%
- Sample Size: 10

Example Predictions:

Actual: when students misunderstand numerical exponent patterns, resorting to computation instead of recognizing generalizable patterns.
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case involves misunderstanding the concept of exponents and how to evaluate expressions involving them. The student incorrectly interprets the expression \(9^3 - 5^4\) as repeated addition, treating the exponents as multipliers rather than powers. Specifically, they interpret \(9^3\) as \(9 + 9 + 9\) and \(5^4\) as \(5 + 5 + 5 + 5\), which is incorrect. The correct interpretation should be \(9^3 = 9 \times 9 \times 9\) and \(5^4 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5\). This misconception indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how exponents function in mathematical operations.
Exact Match: False

Actual: when students don't understand how to represent proportional relationships.
Predicted: The mathematical misconception in this case likely involves misunderstanding the concept of fractions and parts of a whole. When students are asked to identify the shaded part of a figure and write it as a fraction, they might incorrectly interpret the total number of parts or the number of shaded parts.

In this specific example, the incorrect answer "2/2" suggests that the student might be misunderstanding the representation of fractions. They might be confusing the fraction with the idea of "whole" or "complete," thinking that since something is shaded, it represents the whole figure, hence writing "2/2" which simplifies to 1. Alternatively, they might be miscounting the number of parts or not recognizing the correct relationship between the shaded and unshaded parts.

This misconception highlights a lack of understanding of how fractions represent parts of a whole, where the numerator indicates the number of shaded parts and the denominator indicates the total number of equal parts in the whole.
