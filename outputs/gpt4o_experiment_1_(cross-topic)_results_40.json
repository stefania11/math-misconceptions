A 5-kg package costs $9.00.\n\nTo find the cost structure, let's assume the cost to ship a package is composed of a fixed base cost (B) plus a variable cost per kilogram (C). Therefore, the cost equation can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = B + C \\times \\text{Weight (kg)} \\]\n\nWe can set up the following system of equations based on the given data:\n\n1. \\( B + 8C = 12.90 \\)\n2. \\( B + 3C = 6.40 \\)\n3. \\( B + 5C = 9.00 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations to find B and C.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[ (B + 8C) - (B + 3C) = 12.90 - 6.40 \\]\n\\[ 5C = 6.50 \\]\n\\[ C = 1.30 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( C = 1.30 \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ B + 3(1.30) = 6.40 \\]\n\\[ B + 3.90 = 6.40 \\]\n\\[ B = 2.50 \\]\n\nThus, the cost structure is:\n- Base cost (B) = $2.50\n- Cost per kilogram (C) = $1.30\n\nTherefore, the cost to ship a 1-kg package would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost for 1 kg} = B + 1 \\times C = 2.50 + 1.30 = 3.80 \\]\n\nEach additional kilogram would cost $1.30.",

    "actual_misconception": "when students wrongly divide fractions by splitting numerators and denominators into separate divisions, ignoring remainders",
    "predicted_misconception": "The incorrect answer provided, \\( \\frac{7}{5} \\div \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} \\), demonstrates a misunderstanding of how to divide fractions. Let's go through the correct process:\n\nTo divide fractions, you multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping its numerator and denominator. Therefore, the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nThe correct calculation is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{5} \\div \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{7}{5} \\times \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply the numerators and the denominators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\times 2}{5 \\times 3} = \\frac{14}{15}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\( \\frac{14}{15} \\), not \\( \\frac{2}{2} \\). The error likely arose from incorrectly simplifying or misunderstanding the division process for fractions.",
